Hello brave Ottawa Rubyists!

Thanks again for coming out to last week’s Ruby Noobie Night at Shopify. 

Over the course of a few hours, we collectively came to master the curious and awesome ways of Ruby by way of [RubyMonk](http://rubymonk.com): the coolest code-tutoring service on the web. It was great!

The number one thing I appreciated as someone who has a fair bit of experience teaching Ruby was that the entire lesson was taught over the web. No Ruby to install! No text editors to fight with! None of the regular “my version of Windows bla bla bla administrator access bla bla I’m running Gentoo and need to recompile X.Org before whatever” that’s heard during the first lesson of teaching Ruby.

Awesome.

Collections, Objects, and Strings were all covered in impressive depth. We’re really looking forward to seeing more from [C42](http://c42.in/), the company behind RubyMonk.

I had plans for us to dig into the Ruby Quiz at the end of the [RubyMonk](http://rubymonk.com) work, but it seems like there’s still a pretty steep learning curve even between one of the simpler quizzes like [Secret Santa](http://www.rubyquiz.com/quiz2.html) and what you learn in RubyMonk. The big speedbump we hit when trying out the quiz was working with STDIN, which was a concept many new folks weren’t comfortable with due to only having played with Ruby in the web browser.

Unfortunately, by the time I realized that we should just simulate STDIN with a plain String, we were out of time. Lesson definitely learned. I also unfortunately forgot to mention that [Joshua Wehner](http://twitter.com/jaw6) pointed out the also-awesome [Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/) project which is similar to RubyMonk and is definitely worth investigating.

Next up for Ruby Noobie: Rails for Zombies. Has anyone gone through the [awesome tutorial](http://railsforzombies.org/) yet? Post about it in the always [friendly Ottawa Ruby group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ogre-list).
