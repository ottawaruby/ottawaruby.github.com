Install
-------

Install required gems to get a development environment set up:

    $ bundle install

Developing
----------

First, start up the jekyll server locally:

    $ bundle exec jekyll --server --auto

We're using SCSS so you'll want to edit those files if you're doing any styling, not the css files. You can run `compass watch .` and it will compile the css for you as the scss files change.

Posting new articles
--------------------

1. Fill your heart with joy! (This is not optional.)
2. Make a new Markdown /_posts/timestamp-title.md file that looks like the others
3. Check your changes locally by starting up the dev environment above
4. Chuckle at your own sharp wit
5. Git push that article up to the interwebs
6. Double check and make sure things went to plan
7. Tell all your friends with Twitter, Facebook, bla bla bla.
